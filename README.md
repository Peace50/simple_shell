SIMPLE SHELL

A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) program that provides a user interface for interacting with an operating system, primarily by executing commands. It's a text-based interface that allows users to enter text commands and receive text-based responses from the operating system.

Here's how a shell typically works:

Command Entry->
Parsing->
Command Execution->
Process Creation->
Input and Output Redirection->
Command Execution->
Exit Status->
Prompt->
Scripting->
